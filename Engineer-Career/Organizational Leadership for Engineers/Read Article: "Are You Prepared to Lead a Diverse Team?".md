* Developing Culture Competency
  * Self-assessment for positive growth.
    * Pro tip: Commit to educating yourself on the different backgrounds of your teammates. People are a lot more comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work when managers show a sincere interest in who they are as people. Doing this work will help folks see that you value each of them and their unique contributions.
  * Practice active listening.
    * Pro tip:  Diverse team members can bring a wide range of skills, experiences, and perspectives to the table when given a chance. By speaking last, as opposed to first, you help create a space where people feel comfortable voicing their opinions and communicating their needs — because they know you want to hear theirs voice and learn about their experiences. As a result, you’ll create a more psychologically safe space, an environment that encourages people to be open about the challenges they experience at work.
  * Ensure equity in retention and promotion.
    * Pro tip: To support your argument, source the data. As work increasingly crosses borders, cultural diversity in the workplace is inevitable. You must be able to motivate people from diverse backgrounds, and consequential accountability helps signal an expectation of cultural competency at all levels.

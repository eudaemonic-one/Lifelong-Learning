## Teams in a Changing World

Most important skills: active listening and reflection

Build trust and interdependence necessary to move from individual accountability to mutual accountability.

## Behaviors that Build Trust

Keeping Track of Reliable Promises

A sincere “no” is usually better than a half-hearted “ok.”

Use emotional intelligence. Make regular use of these important words:
* I’m not sure. What do you think?
* I was wrong. You were right.
* Good job!

Premortem - early on in a project in which people who understand the project but are concerned about its potential for failure feel free to express their thoughts.

Communicating Clearly, Sometimes Using Stories

## Team Motivators and Demotivators

Motivators:
* A sense of purpose
* Clear performance metrics
* Assigning the right tasks to the right people
* Encouraging individual achievement
* Sailboat rules communication, in which no one tasks offsense for clear reaction
* Mentorship
* Consistency and follow-through

Demotivators:
* Unrealistic or unarticulated expectations
* Inaffective or absent accountability
* Lack of discipline
* Anti-team behavior

## Managing Transitions

High performing teams develop a rhythm.

## Self-Organizing Agile Teams

Self-organizing team - group of motivated individuals, who work together toward a goal, have the ability and authority to take decisions, and readily adapt to changing demands.

## The Power of Diversity

Even among people from similar backgrounds, differences in personality can invigorate a team, injecting fresh perspectives and new ideas. A team of diverse personality types can be a challenge to manage, but such a team generates richer input on the project’s progress, increasing the odds of project success.

## Virtual Teams: A Special Challenge

* Verify that your communication technology works reliably, and that team members know how to use it.
* Take a few minutes before each virtual meeting to share some personal news, so that team members can get to know each other.
* Use video conferencing whenever possible, so everyone can see each other. The video image can go a long way toward humanizing your counterparts in distant locales.

## Core Considerations of Leadership

In such an unpredictable environment, the truly effective project manager is one who can adapt, learn, and perceive a kind of order—living order—in the chaos.

## Practical Tips

* At the end of every day, summarize what you and your team accomplished.
* Establish a clear vision of what constitutes project success, and then work hard in the early stages to overcome any hurdles.
* Build trust by establishing clear rules for communication.
* Take time to reassess.
* Consider the possibility that you are the problem.
* Learn how to facilitate group interactions.

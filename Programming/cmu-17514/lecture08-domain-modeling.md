# Lecture 08 Domain Modeling

## Domain Model

* Ready-world conecpts
* Requirements, concepts
* Relations
* Sovling a problem

## Interaction diagrams: to visualize dynamic behavior

* shows for a singlec scenario to use, the events that occur across the system's boundary or between subsystems
* Clarifies interactions
  * Between the program and its environment
  * Between major parts of the program
* **Sequence Diagram**

## Understanding a design problem: Object-oriented analysis

* Input to design process: Requirements and use cases
* Identify key concepts of the domain description
  * Brainstorm with a domain expert
* Visualize as a UML class diagram, a **domain model**
  * Show relationships and cardinalities
* Understanding system behavior with sequence diagram
  * Identify and define the interface of the **system**
  * Input: Domain decription and one use case
  * Output: A sequence diagram of system-level operations
* Formalize system behavior with **behavioral contracts**
  * Ex. Software specification
  * Operation
  * Pre-conditions
  * Post-conditions

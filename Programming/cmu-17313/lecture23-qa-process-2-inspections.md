# Lecture 23 QA Process 2: Inspection/Code Review

## Code Review

* Isn't testing sufficient?
  * Errors can mask other errors
  * Only completed implementations can be tested
  * Design documents cannot be tested
  * Tests don't check code quality
* A second pair of eyes
* Reasons for code reviews
  * Finding defects
  * Code improvement
  * Identify alternative solutions
  * Knowledge transfer
  * Team awareness and transparency
  * Shared code ownership

## Formal Inspection

* Group of developers meet to formally review code or other artifacts
* Typically 4-5 people (min 3)
  * Author
  * Inspector
  * Reader
  * Scribe
  * Moderator
* Checklists
  * Reminder what to look for
  * Include issues detected in the past
* Authors do not explain or defend the code - not objective
* Read walks through the code line by line, explaining it

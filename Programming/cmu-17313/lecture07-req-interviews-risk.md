# Lecture 7 Requirements 2: Interviews, and Risk

## Requirements Elicitation

### Typical Steps

* Identify stakeholders
* Understand the domain
* Discover the real needs
* Explore alternatives to address needs

### Defineing Actors/Agents

* An actor is an entity that interacts with the system for the purpose of completing an event
* Actors can be a user, an organization, a device, or an external system

### Stakeholder Analysis

* Relevant positions in the organization
* Effective role in making decisions about the system
* Level of domain expertise
* Exposure to perceived problems
* Influence in system acceptance
* Personal objectives and conflicts of interest

### Challenges

* Distributed knowledge
* Conflicting knowledge
* Difficult to access sources
* Communication barriers (cultural, terminology, background)
* Hidden needs, tactic knowledge
* Politics, unstable conditions

## Interviews

### Interview Tradeoffs

* Strengths
  * What stakeholders do, feel, prefer
  * How they interact with the system
  * Challenges with current systems
* Weaknesses
  * Subjective, inconsistencies
  * Capturing domain knowledge
  * Technical subtlety
  * Organizational issues, such as politics
  * Hinges on interviewer skill

### Interview Process

* Identify stakeholder of interest and target information to be gathered
* Conduct interview
* Record + transcribe interview
* Report important findings
* Check validity of report with interviewee

### Guidelines for Effective Interviews

* Identify the right interviewee sample for full coverage of issues
  * different responsibilities, expertise, tasks, exposure to problems
* Come prepared, to focus on right issue at right time
  * background study first
  * predesign a sequence of questions for this interviewee
* Centre the interview's work & concerns
* Keep control over the interview
* Make the interviewee feel comfortable
* Be open-minded, flexible in case of unexpected answers
* Ask why-questions without being offending
* Avoid certain types of questions
  * Opinion or biased
  * Affirmative
  * Obvious or impossible answer for this interviewee

## Prototypes, Mockups, Stories

* Mock-ups/prototypes help explore uncertainty in the requirements

### Rapid prototyping

* Throw-away: developed to learn more about a problem, not intended for actual use
* Evolutionary: intended to be incorporated into the final product

### Story

* Storyboards illustrate scenarios: a typical sequence of interaction among system components that meets an implicit objective

## Resolving Conflicts

### Types of Inconsistency

* Terminology clash: same concept named differently in different statements
* Designation clash: same name for different concepts in different statements
* Structure clash: same concept structured differently in different statements

### Handling Inconsistencies

* Terminology, designation, structure: Build glossary
* Weak, strong conflicts: Negotiation required
* Keep connections between requirements
  * What follows from what?

## Risk

* A risk is an uncertain factor that may result in a loss of satisfaction of a corresponding objective
* Risks consist of multiple parts:
  * Likelihood of failure
  * Negative consequences or impact of failure
  * Causal agent and weakness
* Risk = Likelihood x Impact

### DECIDE Model

* Detect that the action necessary
* Estimate the significance of the action
* Choose a desirable outcome
* Identify actions needed in order to achieve chosen option
* Do the necessary action to achieve change
* Evaluate the effects of the action

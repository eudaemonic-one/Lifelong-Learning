# Lecture 22 Quality Assurance Process

## Case Study: QA (Previously) at Microsoft

* Metrics
  * Number of open bugs by severity
  * Performance metrics
  * Bug data used for deciding when ready to ship
* Process Audits
  * Informal 1-week audits in problematic problems
  * Analyzing metrics, interviewing team members
  * Recommendations to pick up best practices from other teams
    * daily builds, automated tests, milestones, reviews
* Code Reviews

## QA Within The Process

* Have QA deliverables at milestones (management policy)
* Change development practices (request developer buy-in)
* Static analysis part of code review
* Track bugs and other quality metrics
* Defect tracking
  * Issues: Bugs, Feature Request, Query
* Enforcement
  * Check-in gates
  * Static analysis on commits, shown in review

## Social Aspects

* Testers tend to deliver bad news
* Good test suits raise confidence, encourage shared code ownership
* Reporting defects
  * Reproducible defects
  * Simple and general

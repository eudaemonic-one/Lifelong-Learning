# Chapter 1. Introduction

* “One thing expert designers know not to do is solve every problem from first principles. Rather, they reuse solutions that have worked for them in the past.”
* “The purpose of this book is to record experience in designing object-oriented software as **design patterns**. Each design pattern systematically names, explains, and evaluates an important and recurring design in object-oriented systems.”


## 1.1 What Is a Design Pattern?

* pattern name: a handle we can use to describe a design problem.
* problem: when to apply the pattern.
* solution: elements that make up the design, thier relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
* Consequence: results and tradeoffs of applying the pattern.

## 1.2 Design Patterns in Smalltalk MVC

* Model/View/Controller (MVC)
* MVC decouples views and models by establishing a subscribe/notify protocol between them.
  * “A view must ensure that its appearance reflects the state of the model.”
  * “Whenever the model’s data changes, the model notifies views that depend on it.”
  * “In response, each view gets an opportunity to update itself. ”
* Views can be nested.
* MVC let you change the way a view responds to user input without changing its visual presentation.
* The View-Controller relationship is an example of the Strategy design pattern.
  * A Strategy is an object that represents an algorithm.
* MVC uses other design patterns, such as Factory Method to specify the default controller class for a view and Decorator to add scrolling to a view.
  * But the main relationships in MVC are given by the Observer, Composite, and Strategy design patterns.

## 1.3 Describing Design Patterns

* Pattern Name and Classification: essence and scheme.
* Intent: rationale and what design issue to address.
* Also Known As: other names.
* Motivation: a scenario that illustrate a design problem.
* Applicability: where to apply.
* Structure: a graphical representation.
* Participants: classes and/or objects.
* Collaborations: how participants carry out their responsibility.
* Consequences: trade-offs and results of using the pattern.
* Implementation: pitfalls, hints, or techniques of implementing the pattern.
* Sample Code: code fragments.
* Known Uses: examples found in real systems.
* Related Patterns: closedly related patterns.

## 1.4 The Catalog of Design Patterns

* **Abstract Factory**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **Adapter**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter letsc classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
* **Bridge**: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
* **Builder**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
* **Chain of Responsibility**: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
* **Command**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
* **Composite**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
* **Decorator**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
* **Facade**: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
* **Factory Method**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
* **Flyweight**: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
* **Interpreter**: Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
* **Iterator**: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
* **Mediator**: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each otehr explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
* **Memento**: Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
* **Observer**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
* **Prototype**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
* **Proxy**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
* **Singleton**: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
* **State**: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
* **Strategy**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
* **Template Method**: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
* **Visitor**: Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

* “Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are static—fixed at compile-time.”
* “Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic.”
* “Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to subclasses, while Creational object patterns defer it to another object.”
* “The Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose classes, while the Structural object patterns describe ways to assemble objects.”
* “The Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas the Behavioral object patterns describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone.”
* “Clearly there are many ways to organize design patterns.”
  * “Some patterns are often used together.”
  * “Some patterns are alternatives.”
  * “Some patterns result in similar designs even though the patterns have different intents.”

## 1.6 How Design Patterns Solve Design Problems

* **Finding Appropriate Objects**
  * Decomposing a system into objects -> encapsulation, granularity, dependency, flexibility, performance, evolution, reusability, and on and on.
  * No counterparts in the real world -> flexible design.
  * Design patterns -> identify less-obvious abstractions -> more flexible and resusable.
* **Determining Object Granularity**
  * How do we decide what should be an object?
* **Specifying Object Interfaces**
  * Interface: the complete set of requests that can be sent to the object.
  * “We speak of an object as having the type “Window” if it accepts all requests for the operations defined in the interface named “Window.”

  * “An object may have many types, and widely different objects can share a type.”
  * Dynamic Binding: the run-time association of a request to an object.
  * Polymorphism: can substitute objects that have identical interfaces for each other at run-time.
  * Design patterns -> define interfaces by identifying their key elements and the kinds of data that get sent across an interface -> specify relationships between interfaces.
* **Specifying Object Implementation**
  * OMT-based notation
    * Class: rectangle with class name in the bold, operations, data comes after the operations. Return types and instance variable types are optional.
    * Instantiates: a dashed arrowhead points to the class of the instantiated objects.
    * Inheritance: a vertical line from a subclass and a triangle pointing to a parent class.
      * The names of abstract classes appear in slanted type.
  * “Programming to an Interface, not an Implementation”
    * “Class inheritance defines an object’s implementation in terms of another object’s implementation. In short, it’s a mechanism for code and representation sharing. In contrast, interface inheritance (or subtyping) describes when an object can be used in place of another.”
  * “Don’t declare variables to be instances of particular concrete classes. Instead, commit only to an interface defined by an abstract class.”

* **Putting Reuse Mechanisms to Work**
  * Inheritance versus Composition
    * Object Inheritance -> let you define the implementation of one class in terms of another's -> internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses.
    * Object Composition -> assemble or compose objects to get more complex functionality -> no internal details of objects are visible.
    * Implementation dependencies -> problems when reuse a subclass (must rewrite parent class when inherited implementation not appropriate for new problem domains) -> limit flexibility and reusability -> cure if to inherit only from abstract classes.
    * “**Favor object composition over class inheritance** helps you keep each class encapsulated and focused on one task. Your classes and class hierarchies will remain small and will be less likely to grow into unmanageable monsters.”
  * Delegation
    * A receiving object delegates operations to its delegate.
    * Delegation -> easy to compose behaviors at run-time and to change the way they're composed -> dynamic, highly parameterized software -> efficiency depends on teh context.
  * Inheritance versus Parameterized Types
    * Generics / Templates: Define a type without specifying all other types it uses and the unspecified ones are supplied as parameters at the point of use.
    * Let you change the types that a class can use, not at run-time.
* **Relating Run-Time and Compile-Time Structure**
  * Run-time structure has little resemblance to its code structure.
  * Frozen code structure -> Compile-time.
  * Aggregation: one object owns or is responsible for another object and they have identical lifetimes.
  * Acquaintance: acquainted objects merely request operations of each other and suggest much looser coupling between objects.
* **Designing for Change**
  * “The key to maximizing reuse lies in anticipating new requirements and changes to existing requirements, and in designing your systems so that they can evolve accordingly.”
  * “Those changes might involve class redefinition and reimplementation, client modification, and retesting.”
  * Common causes of redesign:
    * “Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly.”
    * “Dependence on specific operations.”
    * “Dependence on hardware and software platform.”
    * “Dependence on object representations or implementations.”
    * “Algorithm dependencies.”
    * “Tight coupling.”
    * “Extending functionality by subclassing.”
    * “Inability to alter classes conveniently.”
* Design patterns play in the development of three broad classes of software: application programs, toolkits, and frameworks.

## 1.7 How to Select a Design Pattern

* “Consider how design patterns solve design problems.”
* “Scan Intent sections.”
* “Study how patterns interrelate.”
* “Study patterns of like purpose.”
* “Examine a cause of redesign.”
* “Consider what should be variable in your design.”
  * “Instead of considering what might *force* a change to a design, consider what you want to be *able* to change without redesign. ”

## 1.8 How to Use a Design Pattern

* “Read the pattern once through for an overview.”
  * “Pay particular attention to the Applicability and Consequences sections to ensure the pattern is right for your problem.”
* “Go back and study the Structure, Participants, and Collaborations sections.”
* “Look at the Sample Code section to see a concrete example of the pattern in code.”
* “Choose names for pattern participants that are meaningful in the application context.”
  * “The names for participants in design patterns are usually too abstract to appear directly in an application. Nevertheless, it’s useful to incorporate the participant name into the name that appears in the application. That helps make the pattern more explicit in the implementation.”
* “Define the classes.”
  * “Declare their interfaces, establish their inheritance relationships, and define the instance variables that represent data and object references.”
  * “Identify existing classes in your application that the pattern will affect, and modify them accordingly.”

* “Define application-specific names for operations in the pattern.”
  * “Use the responsibilities and collaborations associated with each operation as a guide.”
* “Implement the operations to carry out the responsibilities and collaborations in the pattern.”

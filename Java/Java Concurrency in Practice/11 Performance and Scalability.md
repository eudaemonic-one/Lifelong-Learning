# Chapter 11. Performance and Scalability

* Threads
  * => improve resource utilization
    * => exploit available processing capacity
  * => improve responsiveness
    * => begin processing new tasks immediately while existing still running tasks
* Techniques for analyzing, monitoring, improving concurrent performance => complexity => increase the likelihood of safety and liveness failures.
* Safety always comes first.

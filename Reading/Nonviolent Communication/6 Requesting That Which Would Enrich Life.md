# 6 Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life

* **Using Positive Action Language**
  * People are often confused as to what is actually being requested, negative requests are likely to provoke resistance.
  * Speak in terms of what I *did* want to do rather than what I *didn't* want to do.
  * Word our requests in the form of concrete actions that others can undertaken and to avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing.
    * e.g., “I want you to feel free to express yourself around me.” => “I’d like you to tell me what I might do to make it easier for you to feel free to express yourselves around me.”
  * Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.
  * Vague language contributes to internal confusion.
  * Depression is the reward we get for being "good."
* **Making Requests Consciously**
  * When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do.
    * => we might assume that the listener has understood the underlying request.
  * We are often not conscious of what we are requesting.
    * => we may expect an empathic connection, either verbal or nonverbal acknowledgment.
    * => we may wish to know the listener's honest reaction to our words.
    * => we may be requesting an action that we hope would fulfill our needs.
  * The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that we'll get it.
* **Asking for a Reflection**
  * To make sure the message we sent is the message that's received, ask the listener to reflect it back.
    * => restate parts of our message to address any discrepancy or omission we might have noticed in their reflection.
    * “Could you tell me what you just heard me say?” => “I’m grateful to you for telling me what you heard. I can see that I didn’t make myself as clear as I’d have liked, so let me try again.”
    * Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection.
    * Empathize with the listener who doesn't want to reflect back.
* **Requesting Honesty**
  * After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know:
    * what the listener is feeling.
      * “I would like you to tell me how you feel about what I just said, and your reasons for feeling as you do.”

    * what the listener is thinking.
      * “I’d like you to tell me if you predict that my proposal would be successful, and if not, what you believe would prevent its success,”

    * whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action.
      * “I’d like you to tell me if you would be willing to postpone our meeting for one week.”
* **Making Requests of a Group**
  * In a group, much of time is wasted when speakers aren't certain what response they're wanting.
    * the initiator of the conversation => “You need not say more. I feel satisfied and am now ready to move on to something else.”
* **Requesting versus Demands**
  * When the other person hears a demand from us, they see two options: to submit or to rebel.
  * To tell if it's a demand or a request, observe what the speaker does if the request is not compiled with.
  * It's a demand if the speaker then criticizes or judges.
  * It's a demand if the speaker then lays a guilt trip.
  * It's a request if the speaker then shows empathy toward the other person's needs.
* **Defining Our Objective When Making Requests**
  * Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.
  * Prevent transforming requests into demands:
    * e.g., *should*, *supposed*, *deserve*, *I'm justified to*, *I have a right to*.
* **Summary**
  * “The fourth component of NVC addresses the question of what we would like to request of each other to enrich each of our lives. We try to avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing, and remember to use positive action language by stating what we are requesting rather than what we are not.”
  * “Each time we speak, the clearer we are about what we want back, the more likely we are to get it. Since the message we send is not always the message that’s received, we need to learn how to find out if our message has been accurately heard. Especially when we are expressing ourselves in a group, we need to be clear about the nature of the response we are wanting. Otherwise we may be initiating unproductive conversations that waste considerable group time.”
  * “Requests are received as demands when listeners believe that they will be blamed or punished if they do not comply. We can help others trust that we are requesting, not demanding, by indicating our desire for them to comply only if they can do so willingly. The objective of NVC is not to change people and their behavior in order to get our way; it is to establish relationships based on honesty and empathy that will eventually fulfill everyone’s needs.”

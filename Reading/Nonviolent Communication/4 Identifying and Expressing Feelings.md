# 4 Identifying and Expressing Feelings

* The Heavy Cost of Unexpressed Feelings
  * opinion != feeling
  * strengthening feelings => can benefit intimate relationships and also professional world.
  * Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.
  * Hiding our feelings => can have a pronounced effect.
* Feelings versus Non-Feelings
  * Distinguish feelings from thoughts.
    * *I feel* versus *I think*
    * Not clearly expressed when the word *feel* is followed by:
      * words such as *that*, *like*, *as if*
      * pronouns *I*, *you*, *he*, *she*, *they*, *it*
      * names or nouns referring to people
  * Distinguish between *what we feel* and *what we think we are*.
    * Likewise, differentiate between *what we think others are doing around us* and *words that describe actual feelings*.
    * how we *interpret others*, rather than how we *feel*:
      * e.g., abandoned, abused, attacked, betrayed, boxed-in, bullied, cheated, coerced, co-opted, cornered, diminished, distrusted, interrupted, intimidated, let down, manipulated, misunderstood, neglected, overworked, patronized, pressured, provoked, put down, rejected, taken for granted, threatened, unappreciated, unheard, unseen, unsupported, unwanted, used.

* **Summary**
  * “The second component necessary for expressing ourselves is feelings. By developing a vocabulary of feelings that allows us to clearly and specifically name or identify our emotions, we can connect more easily with one another. Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts. NVC distinguishes the expression of actual feelings from words and statements that describe thoughts, assessments, and interpretations.”

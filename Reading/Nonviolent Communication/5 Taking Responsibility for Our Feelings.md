# 5 Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings

* **Hearing a Negative Message: Four Options**
  * What others say and do may be the *stimulus*, but never the *cause*, of our feelings.
  * our particular needs + expectations + how we *choose* to receive what others say and do => our feelings.
  * Four options:
    * blame ourselves.
      * “Oh, I should’ve been more sensitive!”
      * => guilt, shame, and depression.
    * blame others.
      * “You have no right to say that! I am always considering your needs. You’re the one who is really self-centered.”
      * => anger.
    * sense our own feelings and needs
      * “When I hear you say that I am the most self-centered person you’ve ever met, I feel hurt, because I need some recognition of my efforts to be considerate of your preferences.”
      * By focusing attention on our own feelings and needs, we become conscious that our current feeling of hurt derives from a need for our efforts to be recognized.
    * sense others' feelings and needs.
      * “Are you feeling hurt because you need more consideration for your preferences?”
  * Connect your feeling with your need: "I feel ... because I need ..."
    * identifying what need, desire, expectation, hope, or value has not been fulfilled.
    * connect our feelings to our own needs => easier for thers to respond compassionately.
  * Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt.
    * attribute the responsibility for one's own feelings to others => motivating by guilt.
* **The Needs at the Roots of Feelings**
  * Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs.
    * e.g., judments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others.
  * If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.
    * => no self-defense or counterattack from others.
    * when people are used to analyzing and blaming one another rather than clearly expressing what they need => matters get worse.
  * Basic human needs:
    * Autonomy
      * to choose one's dreams, goals, values
      * to choose one's plan for fulfilling one's dreams, goals, values
    * Celebration
      * to celebrate the creation of life and dreams fulfilled
      * to celebrate losses: loved ones, dreams, etc.
    * Integrity
      * authenticity, creativity, meaning, self-worth
    * Interdependence
      * acceptance, appreciation, closeness, community
      * consideration
      * contribution to the enrichment of lie
      * emotional safety, empathy, honesty
      * love
      * reassurance, respect, support, trust, understanding, warmth
    * Play
      * fun, laughter
    * Spiritual Communion
      * beauty, harmony, inspiration, order, peace
    * Physical Nurturance
      * air, food, shelter, touch, water
      * movement, exercise
      * protection from life-threatening forms of life
      * rest, sexual expression
* **The Pain of Expressing Our Needs versus the Pain of Not Expressing Our Needs**
  * If we don't value our needs, others may not either.
* **From Emotional Slavery to Emotional Liberation**
  * First stage: Emotional slavery.
    * We see ourselves responsible for others' feelings.
      * => detrimental to intimate relationships.
  * Second Stage: The obnoxious stage.
    * We feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible for others' feelings.
      * => we are clear what we are not responsible *for*.
      * => simply asserting out own needs.
      * => we have to learn how to be responsible *to* others.
  * Third stage: Emotional liberation.
    * We take responsibility for our intentions and actions.
      * => we respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or shame.
      * => fulfilling to both us and whose who receive our efforts.
    * We accept full responsibility for our own intentions and actions, but not for the feelings of others.
      * => stating clearly what we need in a way that communicates we are equally concerned that the needs of others be fulfilled.
* **Summary**
  * “The third component of NVC is the acknowledgment of the needs behind our feelings. What others say and do may be the stimulus for, but never the cause of, our feelings. When someone communicates negatively, we have four options as to how to receive the message: (1) blame ourselves, (2) blame others, (3) sense our own feelings and needs, (4) sense the feelings and needs hidden in the other person’s negative message.”
  * “Judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others are all alienated expressions of our own needs and values. When others hear criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack. The more directly we can connect our feelings to our needs, the easier it is for others to respond compassionately.”
  * “In a world where we are often harshly judged for identifying and revealing our needs, doing so can be very frightening, especially for women who are socialized to ignore their own needs while caring for others.”
  * “In the course of developing emotional responsibility, most of us experience three stages: (1) “emotional slavery”—believing ourselves responsible for the feelings of others, (2) “the obnoxious stage”—in which we refuse to admit to caring what anyone else feels or needs, and (3) “emotional liberation”—in which we accept full responsibility for our own feelings but not the feelings of others, while being aware that we can never meet our own needs at the expense of others.”

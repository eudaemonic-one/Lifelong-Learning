# 8 The Power of Empathy

* **Empathy That Heals**
  * Empathy allows us "to perceive our world in a new way to go on."
    * “When … someone really hears you without passing judgment on you, without trying to take responsibility for you, without trying to mold you, it feels damn good! … When I have been listened to and when I have been heard, I am able to reperceive my world in a new way and to go on. It is astonishing how elements that seem insoluble become soluble when someone listens, how confusions that seem irremediable turn into relatively clear flowing streams when one is heard.”
  * "Don't just do something ..."
  * It's harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources.
* **Empathy and the Ability to Be Vulnerable**
  * The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.
    * => touch their humanness, realize the common qualities we share.
  * We "say a lot" by listening for other people's feelings and needs.
* **Using Empathy to Defuse Danger**
  * offer empathy to people in stressful situation => defuse potential violence.
  * Rather than put your "but" in the face of an angry person, empathize.
  * When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters.
  * It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to use.
* **Empathy in Hearing Someone's "No"**
  * Empathizing with someone's "no" protects us from taking it personally.
* **Empathy to Revive a Lifeless Conversation**
  * To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy.
    * the best time to interrupt is when we've heard one word more than we want to hear.
    * tuning in to possible feelings and needs.
  * What bores the listener bores the speaker too.
  * Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen.
    * “Excuse me, I’m feeling impatient because I’d like to be more connected with you, but our conversation isn’t creating the kind of connection I’m wanting. I’d like to know if the conversation we’ve been having is meeting your needs, and if so, what needs of yours are being met through it.”
* **Empathy for Silence**
  * Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.
  * Empathy lies in our ability to be present.
* **Summary**
  * “Our ability to offer empathy can allow us to stay vulnerable, defuse potential violence, hear the word no without taking it as a rejection, revive a lifeless conversation, and even hear the feelings and needs expressed through silence. Time and again, people transcend the paralyzing effects of psychological pain when they have sufficient contact with someone who can hear them empathically.”

# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## There Will Be Code

* Code => express the requirements ultimately.

## Bad Code

* Good code matters.

## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

* Add more staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity => make more and more messes.

## The Grand Redesign in the Sky

* Eventually management bend to the demands of the developers to redesign the code base and authorize the grand redesign in the sky.
* The redesign team must build a new system that does everything that the old systems does and also keep up with the continuously changes to the old system.

## Attitude

* Managers defend the schedule and requirements; it's your job to defend the code with passion.

## The Primal Conundrum

* Keep code as clean as possible to make the deadline.

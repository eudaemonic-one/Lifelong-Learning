# Chapter 6: Working with Humans

## General Social Skills

* **Manners**
  * "having good manners" => anticipating what causes others stress and taking it out of your interactions, so they can feel secure and peaceful.
  * Accept apologies eagerly; not "np" but "no worries! Things worked out fine."
  * When you go out for lunch, drinks, or anything else that costs money, pay people back absolutely without fail; make sure no one ever feels awkward about whether they'll get their money.
  * When you meet any colleague, shake their hand, smile, and introduce yourself; show that you're glad to work with them.
  * When you lapse in your politeness - by saying something curt, by accidentally wasting someone's time, by cutting someone off, whatever the case may be - apologize thoroughly and earnestly.
  * When others reach out to you, respond as promptly as humanly possible, and apologize when you don't; show that you value their time and consider it a commitment to help them.
  * Don't interrupt in meetings or conversations.
  * Thanks people thoroughly every single time they help you - show that you don't take their help for granted.
* **Giving Credit**
  * acknowledge that good work to your colleagues, their manager, and your mutual peers.
  * either claim credit for their work or allow others to mistakenly attribute it to you.
  * **Thank them directly by email or chat.**
    * “Thanks a lot for your help! This saved me a lot of time!”
  * **Email feedback to them and their manager.**
    * “Cheng went deep on this problem with me and ended up finding a bug that’s been causing crashes for weeks—thanks so much!”
  * **Mention their help in a broader email.**
    * “Special thanks to Guru, whose help on the storage side was essential to hitting this deadline.”
  * **If a team goes above and beyond for you and your team, get them treats to say "thanks*.**
    e.g., cupcakes, donuts, or cookies.
  * **For truly exceptional work, get creative.**
* **A Word About Charm and Positivity**

    * Asking for their thoughts explicitly, both in private and in public, is a vote of respect and a strong compliment.

    * “don’t worry about it, you did your best”
  * **Humility vs. Self-deprecation**
    * Remember that everyone feels dread and self-doubt; we can share it with our friends, but at work we should keep our chins up.

## Delivering Feedback

* **When**
  * Feedback is a gift, but giving it is a risk.
  * Three situations to give constructive feedback:
    * I'm in a position of authority, seniority, or friendship to them, and I think that the feedback will help them succeed personally; in that case, I have a responsibility to help them improve.
    * The behavior in question significantly compromises our shared work; in that case, giving feedback may be a practical necessity.
    * The criticism is mild and the benefit is large.
* **Foundational Principles of Giving Feedback**
  * **Give people the benefit of the doubt.**
    * Tell them you're giving them feedback because you believe they mean well.
  * **Give feedback in the most positive way you can.**
    * Approach conversations with an earnest goal of helping them succeed for their own sake.
    * Starting from respect and optimism rather than contempt or anger.
* **Empathy; Show Your Trust**
  * Feedback lands softer if it comes with understanding.
    * “I think that you may have been too harsh with Steve in that meeting. I was also pretty frustrated that he didn’t come prepared, and I completely agree that he needs to know that he has to do better for this project to succeed. That said, I think he might respond better if we approach him a little more gently.”
  * Acknowledge What's Good
    * The praise needs to be tightly coupled to the feedback.
      * “I think the sections about reliability and performance are clear and persuasive. The section on implementation details is well done, but I think might be too much for this audience.”
* **Phrase Feedback As an Opportunity**
  * We can say, "I think if you do X, something favorable will happen".
    * “I think that the main technical sections are good, but if you add a clear introduction, readers may contextualize them better.”
* **Qualify Your Certainty**
  * When delivering feedback, expressing certainty increases the intensity for the victim.
    * “You need to cover more of the history in your doc.” => “How much does your audience know about the history of this system? Depending on what they know, I think the doc might benefit from a little more history.”
* **Offer Help**
  * Couple feedback with an offer of help showing therefore you're not just raning criticism.
    * “I think the postmortem might need a bit more detail about how the caching system works.” => “I think the postmortem might need a bit more detail about how the caching subsystem works. Are you familiar with it? If you like, I’d be happy to spend a few minutes talking over some of the quirks.”
* **Deliver Feedback 1:1**
  * Deliver feedback 1:! => save your colleague the risk of public emabarrassment.
* **Manage Your Tone of Voice**
  * Do your very best to find a mild, easy, friendly tone.
* **Forget Feedback and Provide Support**
* **Tough Love**
  * Intransigence is going to cause real harm, in every case as a last resort.
  * Once again, we try every gentle tool first, and even when forced to be direct, we'll do our best to encourage.
    * “I don’t think saying that to your boss is going to get good results; I think he’ll experience it to mean that you’re no longer on the same side working toward a common goal, and that is not going to incline him to help you achieve what you want to achieve. I’m telling you this because I think it’s important and I think you can handle the feedback and do better.”

## Receiving Feedback

* Seek feedback often, do your best to receive it with an open mind, and express appreciation whether you agree or not.
  * “Do you mind reading this email and seeing if it’s clear for this audience?”
  * “Do you have any feedback on my presentation? I’d appreciate a second opinion.”
  * “Do you think my question was reasonable in that meeting?”

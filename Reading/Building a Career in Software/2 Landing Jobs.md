## Passing Engineering Interviews

* **What They're Looking For**
  * Ability (in decreasing order)
    * Coding/debugging measured by coding on the fly in interviews and sometimes by a take-home coding problem.
    * Design/architecture measured by a design exercise in an interview.
    * Communication measured by how clearly you express your ideas in interviews.
    * Domain knowledge measured by factual questions and design exercises.
  * Culture fit
    * Enthusiasm for the role
    * Positive attitude and friendliness
    * Whatever interviewers happen to like
* **Acing Coding Interviews**
  * programming interviews, stylized coding, 30-60 minutes, tricky algorithmic problem.
* **Preparation**
  * Solve a bunch of time-pressured coding problems, with real code.
  * Study CS fundamentals.
    * e.g., linked lists, hash tables, trees, sorting, and the (Big-O) analysis of the memory and runtime of all of the above.
    * Brush up on dynamic programming if you're feeling energetic.
  * Brush up on the specific domain of the job, and prepare to discuss the standard technologies architectures in that space.
  * Practice talking through what you're doing to get used to the performance aspect of interviewing; having a friend grill you in a mock interview if you can.
* **On the Day**
  * **Explain what you're doing.**
    * what line of solution you're considering.
    * what problems it might have.
    * what the problem resembles from your past experience.
    * what the tradeoffs are in your solution.
  * **Start with a simple solution.**
    * Explain what you're starting with and why.
  * **Restate the problem and ask clarifying questions.**
    * Refine the problem's requirements.
  * **Stay calm and never give up.**
    * => try a variety of approaches.
    * => talk through a sensible thought process.
    * => record whatever you manage to come up with can easily make up for an imperfect solution.
  * **Code in a language you know well, and make that language Python if possible.**
* **Passing the Rest of the Interview**
  * Prepare a compelling and specific answer to the question, "Why do you want to work here?"
  * Try to balance humility with confidence.
  * Show your enthusiasm for technology when you get the chance; mention a tool you love to use, a book that influenced you.
  * Don't badmouth your previous employer or colleagues.
  * Prepare one or two questions about the company and team.
* **Further Reading**
  * LeetCode
  * Cracking the Coding Interview

## Recruiters

* **Roles**
  * **Coordinators**: Organize on-site interviews.
  * **Sources**: Identify potential candidates.
  * **Recruiters**: Owners of the hiring process after initial sourcing.
* **What You Need to Know As a Colleague**
  * Engineers and managers evaluate candidates in detail and decide when to make offers; candidates decide for themselves what jobs they'll take; recruiters are the conductors of the whole messy process, accountable for ensuring hires actually happen.
  * Challenges in recruiter's job => requires social skills, energy, and adaptability => astonishingly positive, energetic, and well-organized.
* **What You Need to Know As a Candidate**
  * the recruiter is usually your ally in the hiring process.
* **Getting Properly Routed**
  * Vocal in expressing your preferences.
* **Asking Questions**
  * Recruiters are usually happy to help out with any questions.
  * You can ask recruiters to connect you with an engineering manager.

## Levels, Titles, and Compensation at Tech Companies

* **Level and Title**
  * Each level => allowable range of compensation.
  * Title matters
    * => determines your maximum compensation.
    * => help you market yourself as you look for new roles.

| Title                       | Level | Experience (years) | Scope                                                        | Base Salary         |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Software Engineer           | 3     | 0-3                | Do what people tell you.                                     | \$110,000-\$130,000 |
| Software Engineer II        | 4     | 2-6                | Take on a project, do own project management, and work with others. | \$120,000-\$​165,000 |
| Senior Software Engineer    | 5     | 4-?                | Manage projects with numerous moving pieces, lead others, and set some direction. | \$160,000-\$195,000 |
| Staff Software Engineer     | 6     | 8-?                | Lead very large projects and set direction for a large org, almost completely self-directed. | \$190,000-\$230,000 |
| Principle Software Engineer | 7     | 12-?               | Set direction for significant part of the entire company.    | \$220,000-\$250,000 |

* **Compensation**
  * **Base Salary**
    * 2-5% raise annually or 10%+ if you're promoted.
  * **Bonus**
    * calculated based on performance, normally 10-20% of base salary.
  * **Equity Compensation Basics**
    * stock (restricted stock units, or "RSUs") or stock options (incentive stock options, or "ISOs")
    * often structured as grants that "vest" over four years with a one-year "cliff".
    * stock options => if you leave the company, you often have only 30 or 60 days to decide whether to exercise your vested options or let them evaporate into nothing.
  * **Equity Compensation Taxation in the United States**
    * You would be extremely well-advised to consult a tax professional.
    * RSUs at a public company => taxed as regular income => your company will withhold income tax in kind when your grants vest.
    * **Capital Gains Taxes**
      * You pay capital gains taxes when you sell the shares of a long-holding stock, instead of higher income taxes.
    * **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**
      * Stock options have a kind of estimated fair market (FMV) and a strike price.
      * The AMT says that if you exercise a stock option, you may owe taxes on FMV minus strike price.
* **Share Salary Information As Much As Possible**
  * You may find the company's standards on sites like levels.fyi.
  * Sharing as much as compensation information with your friends and colleagues as you possibly can.
* **Negotiating**
  * bands for a given level, interview performance, current compensation, competing offers => an offer package.
  * Level is set by experience and interview performance.
  * The best ammunition you can give is another package to point to, either current compensation or a competing offer.
  * Negotiating with a respectful and positive attitude usually won't harm your eventual relationship with your manager.
    * “The team really impressed me, and I’m excited about the product. My offer at SmartSoft has a base salary of $150k and a similar equity package; can you match them on the base salary?”
    * “Thanks for your quick reply. I really enjoyed my interviews, and the team was really friendly. The base salary looks good to me, but my current package has a 20% bonus target, and Acme Startup doesn’t have a bonus program. Can you balance that out with a bump in the equity or base salary?”

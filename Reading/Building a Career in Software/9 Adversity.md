# Chapter 9: Adversity

## Managing Your Emotions

* **To prepare for recognizing and managing my emotions.**
  * Meditation.
* **To stay cool in moments of strain.**
  * Recognizing that I'm stressed or angry and trying to let it go.
* **To find my empathy.**
  * Reflecting on how others' misbehavior probably comes from their own struggle and doing my best to find empathy for them.
* **To blow off stream.**
  * Pop out for a coffee or walk.

## Yes, Things Are Broken (You Can't Fix Everything on Your First Day)

* Start by listening: ask why things are done a certain way, and ask with an open mind.
* Continue by contributing: build some social capital by doing things the team needs.
* Then, in good time, pick one thing you want to change, and try to change it not by acting like the current choice is dumb but by making a positive, humble case for the advantages of change.

## Conflict Resolution and Dealing with Difficult People

* **Kindness: Plans A, B, and C**
  * warmth, kindness, assertiveness, calm, patience, eagerness.
  * **In a Meeting or by Email**
    * “It sounds like you’re especially concerned about X for reason Y; that makes sense to me. I’ll take the action item to discuss this with you after offline. We’ll make sure {it’s handled/we find a good compromise/we weigh the tradeoffs carefully}.”
    * “It seems we may prioritize A vs B differently. I think that favoring B is very justifiable. I’ll try to explain why I favor A.”
  * **One on One**
    * “Is everything okay? You seem like you might be a little stressed out.”
    * “I got the sense you were frustrated with how that meeting went. I definitely get that it’s a tough issue. Can we chat about how to address those concerns?”
* **Plan D**
  * **Manager feedback** => be slow to escalate.
  * **HR** => for certain classes of misbehavior, e.g., harassment, bully, lawbreaking.
  * **(Very, very rarely) Anger**

## Dealing with HR

* HR, is a representative of your employer.
* Don't assume that HR has done anything for me unless I see an explicit confirmation it's happened.
* When dealing with HR, including recruiters, HR Business Partners, compensation discussions, keep detailed records in my personal email, which has timestamps and which I fully control.

## Making Mistakes

* First, be completely forthright; hiding a mistake shows that you're untrustworthy, which is much worse than causing a bug.
* Second, don't beat yourself up too much.

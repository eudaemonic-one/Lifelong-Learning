# Chapter 13: Effective Email

## The Art of Sending and Not Sending Email

* **Structure**
  * a salutation (or openning), an optional tl;dr, a series of body sections, some kind of closing, and a signature.
* **Salutations**
  * “Hi person or group,”
  * CCing another group.
* **Signatures**
  * **Just your name**
  * **Cheers**
  * **Thanks**
  * **Regards or best**
* **The Importance of TL;DR**
  * **tl;dr Many readers don't have time to read every word of your email, especially executives. Start your emails with an ultra-brief summary in boldface.**
* **Replying On Topic**
  * Ask yourself what exactly is this person asking, reply magnificently on topic.
* **Large Mailing Lists**
  * Large mailing lists are high-risk, low-reward.
  * When you do reply-all, it should be with super-premium content, presented with a positive attitude and respect.
* **Etiquette, Formality, and Polish**
  * Never, ever show anger or disparage another person over email, even 1:! to someone you trust; emails have a way of getting forwarded.
  * Scale your formality with your audience, erring toward more when in doubt.
  * Looping in stakeholders show respect; try to include people who have a reason to care about your subject so they don't feel that business takes place behind their back.
* **The Importance of Links**
  * Link directly to the dashboard, the wiki page, the documentation to provide context.
* **"Remove Me From This List"**
  * Unsubscribe manually or email the list administrator.

## Email Archetypes

* **The Technical Announcement**

```text
“Hi <group>,

tl;dr <thing is happening>. <people will experience some impact>

<background and motivation>

<thing is happening>

<summary implications for readers; what they really need to do; links to more detail>

<invite feedback and offer help>

<signature>”
```

* **The Technical Question**

```text
“I’m trying to <goal>. I’m doing <actions>, but I see <observations>. My best theory is <theory>, because <reason>. Can you <do something specific>?”
```

```text
“We’re observing <observation> starting at <time with time zone>. It is likely causing <experience> for <percentage> of <class of users>. We think <theory> and want help <doing|investigating> <thing> to mitigate>.”
```

```text
“I’m trying to <do a thing>. I <have done some things | already know some things>. To move forward, I want to <do or know something else>. <specific question>.”
```

* **The Operational Risk**

```text
“Hi folks,

tl;dr <tl;dr>

We’ve just become aware that <technical issue>. This implies that <operational risk>. <operator guidance>. We are working on a fix and will keep this list updated. Please reach out with any questions.

<signature>”
```

* **The Project Status Update**
  * People usually care about two things: schedule (when things will be done) and downstream implications (how they can or must use them).
  * Template: Project background, Progress, Impact on stakeholders, Schedule, Plans, Issues.

```text
“Hi <audience>,

<project summary or background link> <key changes>. <overall status/schedule>. <any important announcements>.

Area 1: progress, impact, schedule, plans, problems

...

Area N: progress, impact, schedule, plans, problems

Thanks!

<you>”
```

* **Requesting a Meeting**

```text
“Hi <person>:

I’m on <team> and am currently working on <project>. Right now, I’m <working on part of project>, and <some reason to seek out their help came up>. [I realize you may not be the right person for this question; if I’m wrong, sincere apologies! Otherwise…]2 Would you mind if I schedule a brief meeting to <achieve specific goal>? Thanks so much!

Cheers,

<you>”
```

* **The Intro Email**

```text
“Hi <A> and <B>,

<A>: <B> is <B’s relationship to you>, <background>, <optional quip>. <Reason for connecting you>

<B>: <A> is <A’s relationship to you>, <background>, <optional quip>. <Reason for connecting you>

I’ll leave you two to connect and move me to BCC. Hope you can catch up soon!

<signature>”
```

## Email Strategy

* **Keep Your Inbox Empty**
  * => replying, archiving, or forwarding.
* **Reduce Your Inbound**
* **Folders (Mostly) Don't Help**
* **Emails and To-Dos**
  * Email is not the place to keep your to-do lists.
* **Email Cadence: The Power and Cost of Fast Replies**
  * Two kinds of productive email processing sessions:
    * The focused session, where I set out to drain the queue completely, send my more complex or tricky messages, and process a cornucopia of inanities.
    * The casual glance, where I process at most a couple of emails and see what's doing literally right now.

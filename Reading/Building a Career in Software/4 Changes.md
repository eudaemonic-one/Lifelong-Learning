# Chapter 4: Changes

## On Fear, Confusion, and Self-Loathing: Starting New Jobs

* Because everyone feels that confusion and unease, no (sensible) veterans expect you to know anything, and you certainly will get better.
  * You should expect six months of struggle to arrive at something resembling ease.
* **Onboarding in Practice**
  * What you should do:
    * => refuse to stay blocked
    * => read as much code as you can
    * => ask questions as carefully as you can
    * => take the initiative to befriend your colleagues
    * => take on dirty tasks and debug relentlessly
    * => earn your colleague's respect with hard work and helpfulness
    * => be patient
  * If you have a proper mentor, think hard about the best way to use them.

## When to Change Jobs

* Reevaluate situation every six months.
  * "tour of duty" => commit to myself or to a manager that I will help them achieve some goal, and I go execute on that without a thought to leaving.
  * If you feel a powerful urge to go lasting for 2-3 months, you should go.
  * If it seems like the interesting work on your team is done and it is converging on maintenance and small tweaks, it may be time to go.
  * You should keep track of your compensation relative to your peers on that same six-month cadence; if you're way behind your market wage, make no mistake, you should go get your money.
  * If you feel like you aren't learning, it may be time to go.

## How to Change Jobs: Going Out in Style

* To leave a job => gracefully, gratefully, leaving only beautiful documentation and neatly tied loose ends in your wake.
* **Most importantly**: Not complaining, not bringing others down, and not insulting anyone.
* **Giving at least two full weeks' notice, not including vacation:** make sure your team has ample time to learn what they need to from you.
* **As a top priority:** Documenting every single thing that only you know.
* **As a secondary priority:** Cleaning up tech debt or key bugs.

## Maintenance Is for Suckers: Choosing Teams and Projects

* When choosing projects, you're optimizing for three things: learning, resume/advancement, and satisfaction.
* Seek out the biggest, most impactful problems you can find, deliver impact, maintain what you've built long enough to unambiguously prove success, and clean up any messes you've created.

## The Transition to Management

* Programmers do real stuff; they write code, they operate systems, and they debug outages.
* Managers do everything through the efforts of others.
  * => nurturing humans
  * => organizing projects
  * => managing themselves
  * => accept a life with less direct impact.
  * => have authority, be accountable for a team.
* You might consider a manager if 
  * You love people.
  * You're naturally patient and don't mind difficult collaborations; you're emotionally steady.
  * You don't mind meetings.
  * You're a good communicator and project manager.
  * You're chaffing at the limits of what you can do as an indivisual contributor and looking for more leverage.
* You might consider passing on this one if
  * You're introverted; you hate meetings.
  * You have trouble managing your emotions or struggle with difficult social situations.
  * You really, really adore coding and can't see living without it.

## Adaptability Is Everything

* As technology and business change, you'll face frequent choices between exploiting your expertise and status in a previous wave area and giving those things up status to struggle painfully in a new area.
* A willingness to struggle and change also doesn't guaranteee anything - you can bet on the wrong technology or just become a victim of industry ageism.

## Burnout, Bouncing Back, and Balance

* **The Model**
  * Burnout => work is much more painful than it is rewarding.
  * Avoiding burnout means trying to keep our job rewards stronger than our stressors and refreshing our resilience in our personal lives.
  * Ideal work is
    * **Just hard enough** => neither exhaustive struggle nor excessive ease.
    * **Profitable** => so you have security and comfort.
    * **Educational and varied** => so you feel that you're growing and investing in your future.
    * **Impactful** => so you care about the outcome of your work.
    * **Reasonably comfortable**=> so you don't suffer from discomfort, emotional abuse, social isolation, or surrealist bureaucratic torture every day.
    * **Resonably social** => so you feel a warmth of human connection with your colleagues.
* **Struggle Is Constant**
  * As you grow, you just struggle with bigger problems.
* **Protecting a Corner of Your Life**
  * There's always more to do than can possibly be done; ruthless prioritization is necessary for any success, so we should cultivate it and use it to draw our line.
  * Get and keep:
    * A hobby you can find at lease five minutes a day for.
    * A whole day per week that you absoutely will not work, no matter what.
* **Not Giving a Hoot**
  * Scaling our impact requires us to gradually accept higher stakes of failure and find comfort with that responsibility.
  * Try to overcome intense natural risk aversion.
* **Bouncing Back**
  * Change your job, find a hobby, and be patient.

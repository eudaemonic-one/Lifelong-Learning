# Chapter 11: A Holistic Look at Engineering Communication

## Receiving

* Listening
  * => to understand exactly what someone means and why they mean it.
  * => building relationship with our colleagues and allowing them the satisfaction of being understood.
* **Summarize** ==> into a single sentence.
  * “Just to make sure I’ve understood: I think you’re saying that we shouldn’t tackle feature B until we finish feature A, because we can build B more easily on top of A.”
* **Shut up** => signal respect and humility to colleagues.
* **Follow-up 1:1** => avoid distracting others in a meeting.
* **Do your homework**
  * research a domain before engaging with a colleague, particularly before asking for help.
* **Ask a thoughtful follow-up question**
  * e.g., clarifying things you don't understand.

## Transmitting

* **Relevance**: Talking about things people care about and minimizing things they don't.
  * A product manager likely doesn't care abuot technical details.
  * A project manager is lkely most concerned about schedule and staffing implications.
  * A software engineer likely wants to know about your API.
* **Context**: Making sure your audience has sufficient background to understand you.
  * Do my colleagues know the terms I'm using?
  * Do they understand the technology well enough to follow my argument?
  * Do they know the goals and responsibilities of the key people involved in this issue?
  * What does this person need to get done?
* **Clarity**: Capturing the exact idea you see in your mind's eye.
  * Is my sentence structure simple?
  * Am I speaking clearly, loudly, and reasonably slowly?
* **Efficiency**: Making effective, that is, minimal, use of your audience's time and attention.
  * Could I say less?
  * Could I link to some an explanation instead of describing this here?
* **Sensitivity**: Considering your audience's emotional response to what you're going to say, sometimes known as not making people feel bad unless you need to.
  * What could my audience be stressed/worried about? How can I reassure them?
  * Am I saying anything that might accidentally insult someone else's technology?
* Real-time feedback => your audience's reaction/
  * What do their questions imply about their understanding of what I'm saying?
  * What emotions do I see on their face? Are they confused? Frustrated? Do they have something to say?
  * Does their response suggest a fundamental misunderstanding that I can correct or an area where we have a very different model of the world?
  * Do they seem impatient with my exposition? Could it be that they understand things better than I thought, or care about something different than I expected?
  * Should I change directions or skip part of what I'm planning to say?

## Choosing a Medium

* Three qualities when deciding how to reach out:
  * Sync/async.
  * Bandwidth.
  * Formality.
* **Email** => fully asynchronous; high bandwidth; formality varies.
* **Chat/Instand Messaging** => semi-synchronous; low bandwidth; informal.
  * Many engineers become enraged when someone sends them an opening chat and don't send their actual question at the same time.
  * Decent punctuation is advised; capitalization is not required.
  * Chat is a poor choice for recording a decision.
* **Drive-by Questions (Going to Someone's Desk)** => Fully synchronous; high bandwidth; informal.
  * “Do you have a moment to chat about how to add an endpoint to the Inventory service? I can also schedule us some time later in the week if that’s better.”
* **Scheduled Meetings** => Asynchronous; high bandwidth; formality varies.
* **SMS** => Synchronous; low bandwidth; informal.
* **Synchronous Phone Calls** => Completely synchronous; high bandwidth; informal.

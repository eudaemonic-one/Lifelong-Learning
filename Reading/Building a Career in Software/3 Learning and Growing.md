# Chapter 3: Learning and Growing

* A placeholder => to solve the biggest problems your abilities allow, constantly challenging yourself and nurturing your technical and people skills.
* Trajectory => self-study, mentorship, how companies evaluate performance.

## Read Every Day: The Practice of Study

* We read to acquire three things:
  * Facts we can tactically in your day-to-day jobs.	
    * e.g., optimizations, libraries, or tools.
  * Fundamental concepts we can use to design systems and drive projects.
    * e.g., design patterns, algorithms, project management methodologies, and reliability techniques.
  * A sense of the landscape of the field's technologies, so we're prepared to choose among them.
* Menu:
  * **Technical white papers** => from academia or companies like Google and Facebook can offer theoretical insight.
  * **Conferences** => a broad, practical sense of what's going on in the industry.
  * **Newsletters and blog posts** => a steady flow of bite-sized practical updates.
  * **Books** => the whole landscape for a technology.
  * **Reading code** => the real patterns in successful projects.
  * **Online courses** => bet for a brand new technical area.
  * **Podcasts** => go-to if you drive to work.
  * **Discretionary coding** => really use the systems you've read about.

## Mentorship

* **Finding a Mentor**
  * Seek out advice from a more senior person for mentorship is perfectly reasonable.
  * You should ideally come with a specific issue to ask about and perhaps a concrete proposal for an ongoing relationship.
    * **Explain your goals.**
    * **Suggest that you meet every 2 weeks for 30 minutes**
      * You will come prepared every time to discuss areas you particularly want to grow, and your mentor will share their thoughts and assign reading in those areas.
      * You will come every time with at least two specific questions to ask.
      * You will bring proposals/documents/emails for your mentor to review with you.
* **Making the Most of Your Mentor**
  * Think about ways you want to improve; come to every 1:1 ready to discuss them.
  * Prepare for meetings by thinking about recent challenges; always come with at least two recent struggles to discuss.
  * Maintain a shared 1:1 agenda, and always update that document in advance; it shows your commitment to making the most of the relationship and helps organize the conversation.
* **Imposter Syndrome Is Underrated**
  * Embrace self-skepticism and doubt yourself every day.
  * You should advocate for yourself, take risks, and, as you start to build a track record of solving problems, trust your skills and adaptability.
* **Having Your Own Project Ideas**
  * => to conceive of projects by sheer creativity and insight.
  * => the people's creativity, knowledge => keep learning.
    * Ask your manager, your customers, and your teammates what they think is broken and what opportunities aren't being exploited; maybe they'll put you onto something great.

## Performance Reviews

* The process
  * => executives and the board allocating a pool of money and equity for raises and bonuses => further subdivided down the org tree.
  * => self-reviews and peer feedback.
  * => battle royale-style meetings of managers => calibration => rank employees.
  * => engineers receive their reviews in person from their managers.
    * A compensation package including some or all of cash bonus, cash raise, and equity.
    * A written review structured around a rubric of areas like coding, architecture, and leadership.
    * A promotion (or not).
* **Self-reviews**
  * an annual or semi-annual self-review => making argument that you should get a good review and a good bonus.
  * Document work prodigiously in a worklog.
  * First, it should not just be a list of tasks; you need to construct a narrative that your reader can follow.
    * “I managed the inbound bug queue for the store page, including working with stakeholders to prioritize bugs and fixing over 20 bugs.”
  * Second, your narrative should emphasize not hust your productivity but your leadership, autonomy, and impact.
    * Led meetings.
    * Did your own project management.
    * Proposed new projects.
    * Took the initiative to improve infrastructure.
    * Owned a component expecially managing inbound requests, supporting stakeholders, reviewing code for other teams, etc.
    * Mentored more junior colleagues.
    * Provided design feedback.
  * Finally, advocate yourself instead of enumerating your mistakes.
    * “I should have led more, I should have taken more initiative, I should have seen the big picture more, that is, aspirations to the next level of execution.”
* **Stop Worring About Title**
  * You need your own sense of the meaning of achievement.
  * Because we have the good fortune to build things for a living, skill and achievement create opportunity and fulfillment in the long term.

  * This is an exstential thread, and your team are the saviors. If the team doesn't deliver, it may be disaster.
    * “At the rate the business is scaling, our main database is going to fall over in six months. This migration is going to be painful, but if we don’t do it, the company will not survive; we’re going to make scaling problems a thing of the past.”
  * This is the smartest, most careful team, the stewards whose expertise and diligence put everyone else on track.
    * “We are the stewards of production at this company. This is a tough and sometimes thankless job, but our diligence saves hours of downtime and millions of dollars.”
  * This is the team that gets things done.
    * “Our company’s business is driven by integrating smoothly with every customer installation. Today, we cover 85%, and our sales engineers sweat to cover the difference. Our goal is to bridge this gap, save tons of money on sales engineering, and unlock another order of magnitude of scaling.”
